  " This software has five bugs, and this number doesn't depend on how many bugs have already been found.  " ,
  " An expert is someone brought in at the last minute to share the blame. " ,
  " Debugging is at least twice as hard as writing the program in the first place. So if your code is as clever as you can possibly make it, then by definition you're not smart enough to debug it. " ,
